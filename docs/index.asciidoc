== Features

[role="lead"]
GrowlHandler is a handler for Monolog, that send log records as notification to Growl via the PEAR Net_Growl package.

*But what is Growl ?*

http://growl.info[Growl] is, at origin, a Mac OS X application that listen to notifications sent by applications
and displays them on the desktop using different display styles.

It was ported to http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/[Windows] by Brian Dunnington.

*And what can do the PEAR Net_Growl package ?*

http://pear.php.net/package/Net_Growl[Net_Growl] offers the possibility to send notifications to Growl (Mac or Windows)
from your PHP application through network communication using UDP or GNTP protocols.

Learn more on http://growl/laurent-laville.org[Net_Growl] project's page.
